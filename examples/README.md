Examples of advanced configurations
------------------------------------

Files in this directory are configuration templates you can use to configure
your mail server to do something complicated.

Note, though, many of these examples are verbose or hacky. Ability to handle
complex use-cases is not the top priority for maddy development and so no
effort is made to them easier to implement.

Also, these examples are not complete configuration files to be used as
maddy.conf. You are supposed to use them as a part of your configuration,
adjusting it to work with other things you have.
