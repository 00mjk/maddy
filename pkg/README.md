maddy integration libraries
----------------------------

This directory contains Go packages with stable API that can be used to
interact with maddy, e.g. inspect some of its structures.

Currently there is a configuration file parser and a structured log parser.

API stability is defined by the maddy version following the semantic versioning
rules.
